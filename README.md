## Description

The project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in your browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## User Story
* AS a coding bootcamp student
* I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
* SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reached 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score

## Approach
This project was certainly the largest leap experienced from class to activity.

A breakdown of requirements into pseudo code was my first approach and slowly worked through the individual code sets piecing each together piece-by-piece.

The questions were the easy part. Deciding what var to use as I progressed was where certain resources came in handy in trying to make it make sense.

## Challenges
I struggled. It was suggested to take advantage of ChatGPT for code corrections or filler however, this was not possible due to overload on the system and could not gain access. However, I did find a number of resources on Github that helped tremendously in understanding coding elements particularly around scoring.
