## Description

The project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in your browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

You can find the application for reference here [Timed Code Quiz](https://urbanpatrol.github.io/timed-code-quiz/index.html)

## Approach
Some leeway has been allowed in terms of design but shoudl emulate my existing portfolio site in terms of functioin and somewhat with regard to components used.

It would have been normal practice to add a navigational menu at the very top hwoever, I decided to add it below the hero. The hero will ultimaley be a personal image to add more value to the homepage.

I liked the idea of using a parallax in the background for a hero and did not think this too much a departure from the original design. This was easy to impelement using a copy of W3Schools parallax.

## Challenges
#### *Navigation*
 I struggled way longer than I should have with the navigation and this appears to be a note of contention with me. For some reason I cannot get navigation to do what I want and so will request additional support.

## Frame of Reference
I wish to build out my site to look like this one https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/Lonely/ and ultimatley heading in that direction. TO NOTE: I have used some elements as a frame of reference but have only used Bootstrap, W3Schools, StackOverflow and Google search as code sources.
